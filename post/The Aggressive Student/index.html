<p>Learning is being in a race against yourself. These things help.</p>

<h2 id="the-rapid-acquisistion-of-highly-technical-information">The Rapid Acquisistion of Highly-Technical Information</h2>

<p>Learning very technical information is unique from the general problem of
learning in a few ways. First of all, the end-result is entirely mental. Either
you understand the concepts well enough to accomplish your task, or you do not.
This is in contrast to learning a song on the piano, where a subconscious system
is learning instead, like training motor patterns for rote memorization.</p>

<p>Imagine your current state of skill or knowledge as a wavefront. Inside its
boundary is your &ldquo;known&rdquo;, and outside is the &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;.
Your awareness of an Unknown item is determined by its distance from the
boundary of this wavefront.</p>

<p>A few corollaries:
1) You can only learn what lies against this wavefront.
2) You can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; into the Unknown by attempting (and failing) to
This &ldquo;reaching&rdquo; is defined by your failure to completely learn; otherwise,
you&rsquo;d be at step one. However, this primes you to learn the material.</p>

<p>Imagine casting a net around a topic you don&rsquo;t understand. The &ldquo;net&rdquo; is made of
all the possible connections you can make to this topic; previous training,
analogy to other fields, half-notions of concepts.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-feels">How it feels</h3>

<p>The most important feelings I can associate with learning are boredom,
frustration, confusion, and flow.</p>

<p>Boredom tells you the work is too easy.</p>

<p>Frustration says you are missing something.</p>

<p>Confusion says you have over-reached. This is only a bad thing in large
amounts.</p>

<p>Flow says you&rsquo;ve got it just right. It lies between boredom and confusion.</p>

<h3 id="sequencing-when-to-learn-what">Sequencing | When to Learn What</h3>

<p>Find the highest-level summary of the topic you can. Then a slightly more
verbose description. Then yet another more verbosity write-up. Etc., etc.</p>

<p>When in doubt, jump in. Write down what confuses you. Keep going until the
confusion reaches a point that you can no longer pretend to know what&rsquo;s going
on. The list you&rsquo;ve written is where you&rsquo;ll start tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="spacing-when-to-learn">Spacing | When to Learn</h3>

<p>Learn until one of these two things happen: You feel confused, or you&rsquo;ve
grasped a new topic but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to teach it well yourself. This is
where you&rsquo;ll pick up from.</p>

<p>As you revisit topics, mix in sources. If you began your exploration with an
online course, try: A blog post, a YouTube video, a textbook.</p>

<p>The day after learning, review your notes.  The next day, summarize them. Where
possible, use drawings and analogy.</p>

<h2 id="basic-tips">Basic tips</h2>

<p>Only highlight/underline what you don&rsquo;t understand. It doesn&rsquo;t help you
remember, but it does help you find the gaps when you revisit the material.
Use some kind of notation for removing highlights as you do comprehend the
gaps.</p>
