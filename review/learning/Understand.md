## The Fundamentals to Understanding
Since SQ3R captures so much of what I've currently learned, let us start there.
However, since my system separates the act of understanding from remembering,
we'll curtail it to SQ2R.

1. Survey
    1. Goal: Get a feel for what material you'll be covering, and where the
       boundaries of your current understanding lies.
1. Question
    1. Goal: To make explicit your own lack(s) of understanding regarding the
       material; to focus your efforts on consciously finding specific answers.
    1. Write down questions that were raised in your mind while inspecting
    1. Skim over any associated HW problems
        * Variation=Take a crack at cursorily solving them on a high-level in
          your head.
1. Read (or Watch, or Listen)
    1. Goal: To intake and assimilate the concepts.
    1. Consume material until confused (%50 comprehension), or out of time.
    1. Question the author. Note the Propositions, Evidence, Conclusion they
       present.
    1. Record new questions as they arise.
    1. Use PML (Personal Markup Language)
1. Recite
    1. Goal: To internalize the material through creation.
    1. Answer the questions you've raised.
    1. Work through examples and/or problems.
        1. If unsure as to where to begin, use examples
        1. Otherwise, default to problems

## Open Questions
* What do you do if a section is too difficult?
    * How do you judge difficulty? Subjectively, via flow?

## Recite
### Examples vs. Problems: A Gradient
When should you stop going over examples and start tackling problems? I have yet
to find any scientific approach, but my personal heuristics follow.

* If you don't know where to even start, you need more examples.
* If you struggle for 5-15 minutes and don't know what to do next,
    * Formalize, to the best of your ability, your confusion in the form of
      questions, and use those as your jumping-off point.
* If you can slowly-but-steadily make progress:
    * Congratulations! You've more to learn through application than observance.
      Of course, seek examples to verify and accelerate your approach.
