## Coding
* Use the Math. Where possible, use math to save time on an iteration, index
  more efficiently, etc.
* When going for your final implementation, review the given information. If
  you're not using everything they told you, you're probably missing something.

### Strings
* Ask about whitespace, case sensitivity, and from which alphabet the strings
  are being drawn (ASCII, Unicode, Custom, Unknown size)
