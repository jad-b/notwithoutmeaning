Implement all the major datastructures and algorithms you're going to need. This
includes the following:

    * binary-and-n-ary Trees
    * Graphs (Object-oriented adjacency list)
    * Tries
    * Suffix Tree
    * Stacks & Queues
    * Heaps
    * Vectors (Dynamic Arrays)
    * Hash Table
* Algorithm
    * BFS
    * DFS
    * Binary Search
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Topological sort
    * Dijkstra's algorithm
    * Longest Common Subsequence
    * Knapsack
