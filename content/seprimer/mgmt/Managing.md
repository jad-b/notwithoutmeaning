## How to Make a Decision
1. What is the problem? Seek definition consensus, if possible.
2. How will you measure progress? If unable to quantify, see Step 1.
3. What are your options?
    1. What's the risk & reward of each?
    2. What's the expected impact and required effort?
        * Impact should be a derivative of reward
4. Select the course, first by highest impact, second by lowest effort.
5. Write down the What, Why, and How of your decision.

## How to Accomplish Your Goal
1. Set OKRs to focus efforts
    * No more than 5 O's, with no more than 4 KR's each. Aim for 3 & 3.
    * Objective: What you (measurably) want to have/do.
    * Key Result: Steps you'll (measurably) take to accomplish/acquire the
      Objective.
2. At the start of each week, review progress. Set weekly and daily goals in
   support of achieving your KRs.

## How to Do a Better Job Next Time
1. Talk over your OKRs within their scope.
    * Employees talk over OKRs with their manager. Teams talk over team OKRs;
      company OKRs get discussed by leadership at the company all-hands.
2. Review your decision journal. What would you do differently, knowing what you
   know now? How did you learn these things?

## Team Building
When a new employee joins, plant a tree. Or a bush. Or _whatever_. It is a
beautiful, and inexpensive, analogy for building a forest from a few trees.
