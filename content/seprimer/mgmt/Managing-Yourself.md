To begin, a brief syllogism:

* If you have more than one thing to do at once, then you must choose which thing you will work on.
* Anyone over the age of five will have more than one thing to do at once.
* Thus, anyone over the age of five must choose what to do.

Getting Things Done is a comprehensive time-management framework. Being a
framework, you may find it a bit much, but it does purport to have an answer for
everything. Being a classic, it's worth a try.

GTD is what happens when you refuse to let yourself be ambiguous in your
commitments. Once you start demanding everything you need to do be capture,
categorized, and assigned a specific next action, the rest of the system seems
obvious.

## What you need to have
First and foremost, you need to get your Capture Location(s) straight; see
below.

1. Projects List, for anything with more than one step to complete
2. Project support material, focused around the needs of each project
3. Calendar, for scheduling events
4. Next Actions list, which tells you _exatly_ what to do
5. Waiting For list, for things you've delegated
6. Reference system, both paper and digital.
    * Needs to less than 60 seconds to file _and_ retrieve
7. Someday/Maybe

## The Habits You Need To Build
* Capture _everything_ that hits your mind
* Assigning a Next Action when you handle it
* Doing things that take less than two (or even five) minutes immediately
* Weekly Review of what you've done, what you're working on, and what's new

### Capture
Here's what my current capture Locations
* At Work:
    * Slack, for sending myself notes when away from my computer
    * Legal pad on my desk, good for diagramming
    * `~/todo.md`, a free-form texgt file where I outline todos and sketch ideas
    * email & JIRA, as ways for other people to capture work _for_ me
* At Home:
  * Google Keep: My persistent note store.
  * Moleskine notebook: On-the-go notetaking
  * Whiteboard: Diagramming. Poor choice for remembering though.
  * Email: How other people capture my time.
  * Trello: Personal project board.
