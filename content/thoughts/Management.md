## Management vs. Leadership
### Management
* Doing the thing right
* Being efficient
* Set priorities, and facilitate work.
* Creating, improving, and employing systems

### Leadership
* Doing the right thing
* Setting direction
* Making decisions

## Practices
Requirements must be traceable back to a requestor. That person represents the
reason for the requirement, as well as its primary point of information about
the requirement, until handed-off.

Project Managers should be in charge of projects. Typically, that means they
should interact across many teams.

Measure, if you're not measuring. If you think you can't measure, I've got a
book for you: [How to Measure Anything].

Have a process for setting priorities. It should include considered criteria
and involve at least some objective form of weighing options against each other.
Unlikely overrides should be noted.

Sign-off on the setting of priorities, either implicitly through known company
practices, or explicitly via names-on-the-page. Priorities can only be
overridden by the approval of an equal-or-higher leader to the most senior name
present. For this reason, explicit is better.
